# Dataset Preprocessing Configuration
#
# NOTE: crop_pixels, upsample_factor, and method are automatically inferred
# by analyzing the first image in your dataset. You can override them manually if needed.
#
# PROCESSING BEHAVIOR:
# - Output format: All images are saved as JPG (maximum quality) regardless of input format
# - When downsampling: blur is applied BEFORE scaling (anti-aliasing to prevent artifacts)
# - When upsampling: blur is applied AFTER scaling (smoothing interpolation artifacts)
# - With super-resolution: blur may be applied after AI upsampling for final smoothing
#
# AUTO BLUR CALCULATION:
# - For downsampling by factor s: sigma = 0.5 × s, kernel = 2 × ceil(3 × sigma) + 1
# - For upsampling by factor s: sigma = 0.3 × s, kernel = 2 × ceil(3 × sigma) + 1
# - Set blur_kernel and blur_sigma to "auto" to enable automatic calculation

# Directory paths (can be overridden by command line arguments)
input_dir: "/mnt/sati-data/Sati_data_320x240/TartanGround"    # Input directory containing images
output_dir: "/mnt/sati-data/Sati_data_320x240/TartanGround_320x240"  # Output directory for processed images

# Processing parameters
target_size: [320, 240]     # Output image size [width, height]
blur_kernel: "auto"         # Gaussian blur kernel size ("auto" or integer)
blur_sigma: "auto"          # Gaussian blur sigma ("auto" or float)
apply_blur: true            # Anti-aliasing for downsampling, smoothing for upsampling
batch_size: 256                # Number of images to process in each batch (reduced for Docker memory efficiency)
num_workers: 0               # Number of worker processes for data loading (0 = single process, Docker-safe)
